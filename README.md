# LogisticRegression-Project

You are hired by the Government to do an analysis of car crashes. You are provided details of car crashes, among which some people survived and some didn't. You have to help the government in predicting whether a person will survive or not on the basis of the information given in the data set so as to provide insights that will help the government to make stronger laws for car manufacturers to ensure safety measures. Also, find out the important factors on the basis of which you made your predictions.
Questions for Problem 2:
2.1) Data Ingestion: Read the dataset. Do the descriptive statistics and do null value condition
check, write an inference on it. Perform Univariate and Bivariate Analysis. Do exploratory data
analysis.
2.2) Encode the data (having string values) for Modelling. Data Split: Split the data into train and
test (70:30). Apply Logistic Regression and LDA (linear discriminant analysis).
2.3) Performance Metrics: Check the performance of Predictions on Train and Test sets using
Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Plot ROC curve and get ROC_AUC score for each model. Compare
both the models and write inferences, which model is best/optimized.
2.4) Inference: Based on these predictions, what are the insights and recommendations.


Data Dictionary for Car_Crash
1. dvcat: factor with levels (estimated impact speeds) 1-9km/h, 10-24, 25-39, 40-54, 55+
2. weight: Observation weights, albeit of uncertain accuracy, designed to account for varying
sampling probabilities. (The inverse probability weighting estimator can be used to demonstrate
causality when the researcher cannot conduct a controlled experiment but has observed data to
model)
3. Survived: factor with levels Survived or not_survived
4. airbag: a factor with levels none or airbag
5. seatbelt: a factor with levels none or belted
6. frontal: a numeric vector; 0 = non-frontal, 1=frontal impact
7. sex: a factor with levels f: Female or m: Male
8. ageOFocc: age of occupant in years
9. yearacc: year of accident
10. yearVeh: Year of model of vehicle; a numeric vector
11. abcat: Did one or more (driver or passenger) airbag(s) deploy? This factor has levels deploy,
nodeploy and unavail
12. occRole: a factor with levels driver or pass: passenger
13. deploy: a numeric vector: 0 if an airbag was unavailable or did not deploy; 1 if one or more bags
deployed.
14. injSeverity: a numeric vector; 0: none, 1: possible injury, 2: no incapacity, 3: incapacity, 4: killed;
5: unknown, 6: prior death
15. caseid: character, created by pasting together the populations sampling unit, the case number,
and the vehicle number. Within each year, use this to uniquely identify the vehicle.
